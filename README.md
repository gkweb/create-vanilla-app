# create-vanilla-js-app

A very basic vanilla js boilerplate:

- Includes webpack HMR
- Webpack 4
- Es6 / Babel

Please keep in mind, This is a helper for me to start projects from therefore - I've tried to keep as clean as possible. Add your own packages to suit your own workflow. 

### Start development server with:

`npm run start:dev` or `yarn start:dev`

### Build for production

`npm run build` or `yarn build`
